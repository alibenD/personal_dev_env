#             NOTICE: The file is just a README file, please ignore its postfix '.bash', it is just for using some kinds vim plugin.
#---***********************************************---

#----Script List---
# 1. connect_agv_with_command.bash
# 2. connect_agv.bash
# 3. redis_demo.bash


# In the following, it is a simple tutorial to show how to use scripts in the collection.
#
# 1. Command prototype: "connect_agv_with_command.bash "COMMAND_NAME""
#    e.g. user@localhost:~$ connect_agv_with_command.bash "htop"
#   
#   After you pressed "Enter", several windows, where each agv will be connected respectively, will open and run "htop". 
#   If the command is block-type, the window will hold till you stop or being closed accidently. Otherwise, the window will be closed when the command ran out.


# 2. Command prototype: "connect_agv.bash"
#    e.g. user@localhost:~$ connect_agv.bash
#    
#    After you pressed "Enter", serveral windows will be opened and make connection with agvs via ssh without any command, just connection.


# 3. Command prototype: "redis_demo.bash"
#    e.g. user@localhost:~$ redis_demo.bash
#    
#    The script will execute 3 command, 'roslaunch collvoid_dorabot launch_redisserver.launch', 'rosrun collvoid_dorabot redisserver_forcontrol.py'
#    and 'rviz'
